I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Copenhagen supervised by Professor Isabelle Augenstein. Before joining the <a href="https://www.copenlu.com/" target="\_blank">CopeNLU</a> group I’ve completed the MSc in Statistics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Before that, I’ve obtained a Bachelor of Science in Economics also at the Humboldt University of Berlin. I’m a member of <a href="https://rycolab.io/" target="\_blank">Rycolab</a> at ETH Zürich co-supervised by Ryan Cotterell.

My PhD work focuses on gender bias detection in cross-lingual setups and interpretability. My primary research interests are bias and fairness in NLP, interpretability, and statistical methods.

Besides, prior to starting my PhD I have worked as a data science consultant for <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de.html" target="\_blank">Deloitte Analytics Institute</a>.
